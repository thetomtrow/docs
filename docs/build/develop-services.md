# Develop services

## Prerequisites

This doc assumes that you already have a fluence project, if not, `fluence init` and follow the prompts.

## What is service and why is it needed

A Marine service is a bunch of wasm modules linked together by a config. It is the computation part of the network. When deployed to a Peer, a service is accessible from Aqua.

## Basic example

To create a sample service, use `fluence service new`, like that:

```bash
$ fluence service new services/some_service --name some_service
```

This will create a service structure at `services/some_service`:

```bash
services/some_service
├── modules              <- modules for this service
│   └── some_service
│       ├── Cargo.toml   <- rust crate config
│       ├── module.yaml  <- module configuration file
│       └── src
│           └── main.rs  <- rust source of main module of the service
└── service.yaml         <- service configuration file
```

The default source, `main.rs`, is pretty much a hello world:

```rust
#![allow(non_snake_case)]
use marine_rs_sdk::marine;
use marine_rs_sdk::module_manifest;

module_manifest!();                       // some required stuff, just keep it here

pub fn main() {}                          // will be called one module is started

#[marine]                                 // macro makes function appear in this module interface
pub fn greeting(name: String) -> String {
    format!("Hi, {}", name)
}
```

This service `some_service` now consists of only one module. You can run this service locally in a repl to test. Deployment to the network will be covered by other doc pages (link).

### Repl testing

Run repl using fluence CLI. It accepts service name or path to the directory with `service.yaml` 

```sh
$ fluence service repl some_service
```

You will see some hints and setup information, as well as prompt to execute a command:

```bash
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Execute help inside repl to see available commands.
Current service <module_name> is: some_service
Call some_service service functions in repl like this:

call some_service <function_name> [<arg1>, <arg2>]

Welcome to the Marine REPL (version 0.19.1)
Minimal supported versions
  sdk: 0.6.0
  interface-types: 0.20.0

app service was created with service id = 3b0aaf21-a499-4092-b2ef-890620b285c5
elapsed time 71.005084ms

1> 
```

The most useful commands are `help`, `call`, `interface`, and the commands have shortcats. Here is the output of the `interface command`:

```bash
1> i
Loaded modules interface:
exported data types (combined from all modules):
<no exported data types>

exported functions:
some_service:
  func greeting(name: string) -> string
```

The output says that module has no non-default data structures in interface, and has a `greeting` function, exported from `some_service` module that takes a string as an argument and returns a string.

Using information about interface it can be called:

```bash
2> c some_service greeting "World"
result: "Hi, World"
 elapsed time: 5.047333ms
```

That is the simplest way to execute the service and look if it works. To exit repl press `ctrl + C`.

## More complicated examples

After basic example works its time to go try more features:

* structs in interfaces
* mounted binaries and filesystem access
* multi-module services

### Structs in interfaces

`#[marine]` functions can have numbers, strings, vectors and custom structs in signatures. To be used in signature, a structure must:

* be marked with `#[marine]` macro
* have only numbers, strings, vectors or other `#[marine]` structs as fields

Lets add a structure and a new function in our service:

```rust
#![allow(non_snake_case)]
use marine_rs_sdk::marine;
use marine_rs_sdk::module_manifest;

module_manifest!();

pub fn main() {}

#[marine]
pub struct SomeStruct {
    number: i32,
    string: String,
    vector: Vec<i32>
}

#[marine]
pub fn process_struct(arg: SomeStruct) -> SomeStruct {
    SomeStruct {
        number: arg.number + 1,
        string: format!("{} {}", arg.string, 1),
        vector: vec![arg.vector[0]; 2],
    }
}

#[marine]
pub fn greeting(name: String) -> String {
    format!("Hi, {}", name)
}
```

And then use `fluence service repl some_service` again to run it. Then, `interface` command will show how interface changed:

```bash
1> i
Loaded modules interface:
exported data types (combined from all modules):
data SomeStruct:
  number: i32
  string: string
  vector: []i32

exported functions:
some_service:
  func process_struct(arg: SomeStruct) -> SomeStruct
  func greeting(name: string) -> string 
```

The structure added as `data SomeStruct`, and `process_struct` appeared in the exported function section. Lets call the function then. But how to represent the structure? The answer is as JSON. Repl interprets function arguments as JSON, so it must be a single json value (string, number, array or object). The top-level array or object is always interpreted as a container for function arguments, to handle functions with more than one argument. So, if function has only one argument and it is an array or an object, it is required to wrap it with `[]`. So, here is the call:

```bash
2> c some_service process_struct [{"number": 1, "string": "test", "vector": [4]}]
result: {
  "number": 2,
  "string": "test 1",
  "vector": [
    4,
    4
  ]
}
 elapsed time: 10.09025ms
```

Also, an array can be used instead of object:

```bash
3> c some_service process_struct [[1,"test", [4]]]
result: {
  "number": 2,
  "string": "test 1",
  "vector": [
    4,
    4
  ]
}
 elapsed time: 211.125µs
 ```

### Function imports

 A service can consist of more than one module. A module can import functions from other modules. This is done using `extern "C"`  block wrapped with marine macro, and some attribute. Lets try:

 First, create a new module:

 ```bash
 fluence module new services/some_service/modules/new_module
 ```

 Then, add it to service.yaml of previously created `some_service`

 ```yaml
 # yaml-language-server: $schema=../../.fluence/schemas/service.yaml.json

# Defines a [Marine service](https://fluence.dev/docs/build/concepts/#services), most importantly the modules that the service consists of. For Fluence CLI, **service** - is a directory which contains this config. You can use `fluence service new` command to generate a template for new service

# Documentation: https://github.com/fluencelabs/fluence-cli/tree/main/docs/configs/service.md

version: 0
name: some_service
modules:
  facade:
    get: modules/some_service 
  other:                      # new line. "other" is an arbitrary chosen name, just make it unique
    get: modules/new_module   # new line. here is the path to the dir with module.yaml
 ```

Update new module's to make it more meaningful:

```rust
#![allow(non_snake_case)]
use marine_rs_sdk::marine;
use marine_rs_sdk::module_manifest;

module_manifest!();

pub fn main() {}

#[marine]
pub fn get_hello() -> String {
    format!("Hello")
}
```

And import and use this function in facade module:

```rust
#![allow(non_snake_case)]
use marine_rs_sdk::marine;
use marine_rs_sdk::module_manifest;

module_manifest!();

pub fn main() {}

#[marine]
pub struct SomeStruct {
    number: i32,
    string: String,
    vector: Vec<i32>
}

#[marine]
pub fn process_struct(arg: SomeStruct) -> SomeStruct {
    SomeStruct {
        number: arg.number + 1,
        string: format!("{} {}", arg.string, 1),
        vector: vec![arg.vector[0]; 2],
    }
}

#[marine]
pub fn greeting(name: String) -> String {
    let hello = get_hello();
    format!("{}, {}",  hello, name)
}

#[marine] 
#[link(wasm_import_module = "new_module")] // use the name of .wasm file. In this case it is from [[bin]] section of Cargo.toml of module. "host" is reserved here.
extern "C" {
    fn get_hello() -> String; 
}
```

Now check using repl:

```bash
$ fluence service repl some_service
Making sure service and modules are downloaded and built... ⣽
Making sure service and modules are downloaded and built... done

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Execute help inside repl to see available commands.

Call some_service service functions in repl like this:

call some_service <function_name> [<arg1>, <arg2>]

## Mounted binaries

To unlock some options not possuble in pure wasm, exists a mounted binaries API - a way to call programs on host machine from wasm services. It is similar to the importing functions, the only differences are that `wasm_import_module` must be `"host"` and signatures are predefined.

Lets use the `curl` tool from the host system in our project. First, add import the binary and use it:

```rust
use marine_rs_sdk::MountedBinaryStringResult;

/*... skipped code from previous snippets ...*/  

#[marine]
pub fn call_curl(url: String) -> MountedBinaryStringResult {
  curl(vec![url])
}

#[marine]
#[link(wasm_import_module = "host")]
extern "C" {
    fn curl(cmd: Vec<String>) -> MountedBinaryStringResult;
  
}
```

Function name should match the name in the config, arguments should be `Vec<String>` and return value either `MountedBinaryStringResult` or `MountedBinaryStringResult`. The difference is that the latter transform stdin/stdout to `String` internally, while the other keeps it `Vec<u8>`

Then add the mounted binary to the config `<project_root>/services/some_service/modules/some_service/module.yaml`:

```yaml
version: 0
type: rust
name: some_service
mountedBinaries:
    curl: /usr/bin/curl
```

And now it is runnable:

```bash
$ fluence service repl some_service
Making sure service and modules are downloaded and built... ⣽
Making sure service and modules are downloaded and built... ⢿
Making sure service and modules are downloaded and built... done

## Call Parameters

Peers provide additional information about what's happening to services. This includes where the service is, who initiated the call, where are arguments from. It is known as call parameters and structure definitions are here:

```rust
pub struct CallParameters {
    /// Peer id of the AIR script initiator.
    pub init_peer_id: String,

    /// Id of the current service.
    pub service_id: String,

    /// Id of the service creator.
    pub service_creator_peer_id: String,

    /// PeerId of the peer who hosts this service.
    pub host_id: String,

    /// Id of the particle which execution resulted a call this service.
    pub particle_id: String,

    /// Security tetraplets which described origin of the arguments.
    pub tetraplets: Vec<Vec<SecurityTetraplet>>,
}

pub struct SecurityTetraplet {
    /// Id of a peer where corresponding value was set.
    pub peer_pk: String,

    /// Id of a service that set corresponding value.
    pub service_id: String,

    /// Name of a function that returned corresponding value.
    pub function_name: String,

    /// Value was produced by applying this `json_path` to the output from `call_service`.
    pub json_path: String,
}
```

It is accessible through `marine_rs_sdk::get_call_parameters` function. Here is an example:

```rust
#[marine]
pub fn call_parameters() -> String {
    let cp = marine_rs_sdk::get_call_parameters();
    format!(
        "init_peer_id: {}, service_id: {}, service_creator_peer_id: {}, host_id: {}, particle_id: {}, tetraplets: {:?}",
        cp.init_peer_id,
        cp.service_id,
        cp.service_creator_peer_id,
        cp.host_id,
        cp.particle_id,
        cp.tetraplets
    )
}

```

After adding it to a service, it can be tested. Call parameters can be set manually in repl, as a second json value after arguments:

```sh
$ fluence service repl some_service
Making sure service and modules are downloaded and built... ⣾
Making sure service and modules are downloaded and built... ⣾
Making sure service and modules are downloaded and built... done

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
